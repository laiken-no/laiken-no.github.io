# Arm balance workshop

The purpose of the workshop is to give participants:

* experience with a variety of arm balance poses encountered in yoga
* an understanding of how to progress in each of these poses
* ideas for how to incorporate arm balance into a holistic yoga practice

## Structure

### Introduction

The workshop starts by explaining the approach. Arm balance is characterised by pushing from the shoulders, with the arms, on the hands. Poses are organised according to which direction the shoulder is pushing: forward, down, or up. A general introduction is given emphasising the importance of good form, and about sustaining active breathing while doing the poses.

Each part starts with a set of preparatory poses which prime the body and the mind to recruit the necessary muscles correctly. This also serves to introduce participants to the supporting exercises that can be used to build stength and proprioception in order to progress with the poses.

Once warmed up, the specific arm balance poses are introduced, demonstrated, and participants can try for themselves.

Each part ends off with reflection on the experience, and with suggestions on where to place the poses in a given yoga practice.

* transition from downward dog to chaturanga to upward dog and back as a solid method for building strength
