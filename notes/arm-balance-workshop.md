# Reflections

* arm balance is truly _balance_
* requires dedicated and continuous practice to build strength and technique
* transition from downward dog to chaturanga to upward dog and back as a solid method for building strength
* can be a source of frustration due to the difficulty
* should therefore be used with an accepting attitude, and in the right amount, so it does not compromise the entire practice
* arm balance is fun, intense, exiting, uplifting
* can contribute to enhancing concentration and intensity during a practice
