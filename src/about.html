                        The name "Laiken" is a made up word, chosen to be easily pronouncable, mostly language agnostic, unlikely to be in current use, and is a homophone for the word "lichen".

                        Lichen is complex organism, that is a symbiosis between algae and fungi, and sometimes also bacteria. Apart from producing beautiful colours and shapes, and being useful for foraging, lichens are also fascinating collaborative life forms. They are relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems with complex symbiotic systems acting as partners in what is called a holobiont - an assembly of a host and other species living in or around it through symbiosis.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        The idea of a complex symbiosis between different organisms applies to humans too. Our gut microbiome, for example, hosts many different life forms, some of which influence our behaviour via their effect on the brain, through the bloodstream, and through the central nervous system.

                    </br>
                        The mind too is hosted by the body, and can have a symbiotic relationship with it: the body can support the mind, and the mind can support the body. And it is in this relationship that yoga is a powerful tool - to foster a symbiotic relationship between body and mind. Yoga gives us the tools to intervene in the process by which our bodies and minds develop and interact.

                    </br>
                        My own yoga practice aims to support this beneficial interaction between body and mind so that they can function well together. And in this sense the name "Laiken", via its link to lichen, via its nature as a collaborative organism alludes to the way which I believe yoga should be practiced: such that the body and the mind function in harmony.

                        I'm a South African living in Oslo, Norway. I've been practicing yoga since 2005. For the first ten years I explored different styles: Ashtanga, Hatha, Iyengar, Yin, and Vinyasa.

                    </br>
                        In 2014 I started developing my own sequence - my goal was to design a sequence, grounded in anatomical understanding, that suited my own body's strengths and weaknesses, and that helped me achieve my own goals: stability, strength, mobility, and calm. Initally I wanted my yoga practice to help me climb better. Over time it has evolved to become a more fundamental part of my life. In 2020 I started a serious study of Theravada Buddhism, to better understand how to incorporate meditation into asana practice. In 2024, I completed a 200 hours Yoga Teacher Training in Hatha and Vinyasa at Kjernekraft in Oslo, lead by Ida Engerud and Gry Bech-Hansen.

                        I've always loved movement, and the outdoors, so when time allows, I enjoy rock climbing, mountain biking, and skiing. I'm also interested in foraging plants and mushrooms, and discovering new ways to used foraged goods.

                        I'm also the father of two boys, and work as a software engineer at the University of Oslo.

                    <p>
                        I made this website in order to share my approach to yoga with others - how and why I practice, and what I'm interested in teaching.

                        This website is an exercise in technological minimalism. It is authored by me, as hand-written HTML, has no tracking, no third-party sources, works without stylesheets, and implements responsive design. The source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/laiken-no/laiken-no.github.io" target="_blank">github.com</a>, and served with a custom domain, with DNS services operated by domene.shop.
