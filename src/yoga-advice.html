                        Practice yoga.

                        Which day is better? The one where you practice yoga, or the one where you don't?
                    </br>
                        Which week is better? The one where you practice yoga, or the one where you don't?
                    </br>
                        Which life is better? The one where you practice yoga for the rest of your life, or the one where you don't?
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Practice yoga. Almost every day. For the rest of your life.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Establish your own yoga practice:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>move with intent and awareness
                        <li>build an understanding of your current body
                        <li>use nostril breathing to regulate the intensity of your effort
                        <li>Establish even breaths, with the same duration for the inhale and the exhale
                        <li>focus on high quality movement, good form is paramount
                        <li>don't sacrifice good form in pursuit of reaching further, holding longer, or doing more
                        <li>develop a sequence that is beneficial to you
                        <li>do the most demanding postures while your central nervous system has capacity - make sure you're not too tired
                        <li>keep it under an hour in duration, it will be easier to make time
                        <li>there is never a need to push yourself too hard, you have the rest of your life to practice
                        <li>develop variations on your sequence - some with more intensity than others, choose the variation that is suitable for the day
                        <li>strive for variation in movement and postures: standing balance, arm balance, forward - and backward bends, standing, sitting, lying down, inversions, twists, locks
                        <li>savour the simple postures, try to perfect them, savour the moments of perfection in an otherwise complicated and imperfect life
                        <li>twisting is important, we seldom twist in everyday life
                        <li>take inspiration from beyond yoga
                        <li>perform your sequence mentally, in meditation
                        <li>in a given performance of a sequence, don't try a balancing posture more than three times if you fall out of balance on the way in, don't get frustrated, move on
                        <li>count the durations of your positions in number of breaths
                        <li>5 breaths are enough to get into something
                        <li>10 breaths are enough to really feel it
                        <li>20 breaths are enough to develop lasting mobility
                        <li>set up repetitions in 3's, it's harder to keep count of 5's
                        <li>don't jump, it activates the stretch reflex, this tenses your muscles
                        <li>if you must jump or do sudden movements, do it early in your sequence
                        <li>finish once you've started, the feeling of accomplishment is important for motivation
                        <li>rather move slower than faster
                        <li>rather 10 more breaths than 10 less
                        <li>keep your focus in your body
                        <li>keep your awareness on your mat
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Consider that your practice can give you an hour of unequivocal benefit mentally and physically each time. Consider the sum of this in a week, in a month, in a year. Consider the sum of this over years, 10 years, 20 years, a lifetime. Consider all the time spent creating, and being immersed in beneficial movement. And consider that this stands apart from history. The benefit does not depend on any external circumstances.

                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Having established and performed your practice, for many days, weeks, months, years, consider all the days, weeks, months, and years to come.
